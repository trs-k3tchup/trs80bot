# TRS-80 Color Computer
The RadioShack TRS-80 Color Computer is a line of home computers developed and sold by Tandy Corporation. Despite sharing a name with the earlier TRS-80, the Color Computer is a radical departure with its Motorola 6809E processor rather than a Zilog Z80. The Color Computer line is not compatible with software made for the earlier TRS-80.

The Tandy Color Computer line started in 1980 with what is now called the Color Computer 1. It was followed by the Color Computer 2 in 1983, then the Color Computer 3 in 1986. All three models maintain a high level of software and hardware compatibility, with few programs written for an older model being unable to run on the newer ones. The Color Computer 3 was discontinued in 1991.

# But this obviously isn't a computer.
This is a Discord bot developed by me as a side project. I've seen many Discord bots: good ones, bad one, weird ones, and useless ones. My aim is to create a Discord bot that has it all. Everything from moderation to music to currency, I want EVERYTHING. This bot also serves as a way for me to learn programming, as I'm still very much a beginner.

This bot is still very small and as such is not yet available to the public. Hopefully I will be able to release it in the future!

If you're reading this, welcome to the piece of ancient history that I worked on as a young boy. I will not be updating it.
